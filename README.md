This Python program uses the pynput library to listen to keyboard events.

It imports the Listener class from pynput.keyboard.
It defines a function write_to_file(key) that takes a key event as input.
Inside write_to_file, it converts the key event to a string, removes single quotes, and replaces 'Key.space' with a space if the key pressed is the spacebar.
It then appends the processed key to a file named "log.txt".
Finally, it creates a Listener object with on_press set to the write_to_file function and starts listening for keyboard events
